description=\
The FX.UI module of the GEF4 FX component provides support for properly\n\
integrating JavaFX with SWT. This comprises an enhanced FXCanvas (FXCanvasEx)\n\
that integrates a JavaFX scene graph and (in addition to the JavaFX provided\n\
integration) supports the forwarding of touch gesture events, as well as an\n\
adapter (FXControlAdapter), via which SWT widgets can be embedded into a\n\
JavaFX scene graph (within the context of such an FXCanvasEx).\n
