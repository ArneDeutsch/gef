/**
 * A Guice {@link Scope} that is bound to an {@link IAdaptable}-compliant type
 * and has to be scoped to a respective instance of that type.
 * <p>
 * After the scope has been entered for an {@link IAdaptable} instance (which
 * automatically switches the scope to this {@link IAdaptable} instance), the
 * {@link AdaptableScope} will maintain a set of scoped objects for the
 * respective {@link IAdaptable} instance. The scoped provider being returned by
 * {@link #scope(Key, Provider)} will always (recycle) objects from this set of
 * scoped objects, only creating new instances if a respective instance is not
 * already contained in the set of scoped objects.
 * <p>
 * The {@link AdaptableScope} may be switched between all {@link IAdaptable}
 * instances, for which it has been entered before (upon entering, it will
 * automatically switch to the instance it has been entered for). The scoped
 * provider will always refer to the set of scoped objects bound to the
 * {@link IAdaptable} instance the scope was switched to last, preserving the
 * set of objects instances for all other {@link IAdaptable} instances.
 * <p>
 * Leaving the scope for an {@link IAdaptable} instance will clear the set of
 * scoped objects for this {@link IAdaptable} instance, so no scoped objects may
 * be recycled afterwards. The {@link AdaptableScope} will have to be re-entered
 * for the {@link IAdaptable} instance after it has been left for it.
