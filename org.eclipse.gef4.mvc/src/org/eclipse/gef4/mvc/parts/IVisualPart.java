/**
 * An {@link IVisualPart} plays the controller role in the model-view-controller
 * architecture. While it does not have to bound to a model (actually only
 * {@link IContentPart}s are bound to model elements, {@link IFeedbackPart}s and
 * {@link IHandlePart}s do not refer to model elements), an {@link IVisualPart}
 * controls a visual and is responsible of handling user interaction.
 * <p>
 * Within an {@link IViewer}, {@link IVisualPart} are organized in a hierarchy
 * via a <code>[1:n]</code> parent-children relationship ({@link #getParent()},
 * {@link #getChildren()}), which roots in an {@link IRootPart}. Furthermore a
 * <code>[n:m]</code> anchorage-anchored relationship ( {@link #getAnchorages()}
 * , {@link #getAnchoreds()}) may be established between {@link IVisualPart}s
 * located at arbitrary places within the hierarchy.
 * <p>
 * An {@link IVisualPart} is adaptable ({@link IAdaptable}). Usually,
 * {@link IPolicy}s and {@link IBehavior}s are adapted to it (but arbitrary
 * adapters may indeed be registered as needed). {@link IPolicy}s are usually
 * required in case the {@link IVisualPart} is directly involved in user
 * interaction (e.g. the user clicks on its controlled visual). They may be
 * accessed type-safe by {@link ITool}s or other {@link IPolicy}s (
 * {@link IPolicy}s may delegate to other {@link IPolicy}s) via their class key
 * (see {@link IAdaptable}). {@link IBehavior}s are used to react to changes of
 * the attached model (in case of an {@link IContentPart}s), the viewer models,
 * or others sources (e.g. adapters of the {@link IViewer} or {@link IDomain}),
 * thereby reacting to changes of the interactive state.
 * <p>
 * {@link IVisualPart}s are activatable ({@link IActivatable}), and an
 * activation/deactivation of an {@link IVisualPart} will result in the
 * activation/deactivation of all registered adapters (i.e. {@link IPolicy}s and
 * {@link IBehavior}s).
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Instead, {@link AbstractVisualPart} should be subclassed.
 *
