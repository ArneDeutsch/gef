 * manipulations.

 * Note, that an {@link ITransactional} policy is safe against multiple
 * initialization/commitment in sequence. However, only the first

 * <code>null</code>).
 * <p>
 * If an {@link ITransactional} policy is not initialized, it should throw an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} if any of its "work" methods are called.
