/**
 * This package provides different implementations of concrete layout algorithms. There are a couple of
 * simple algorithms that arrange nodes in a grid ({@link org.eclipse.gef4.layout.algorithms.GridLayoutAlgorithm}),
 * a single column or row ({@link org.eclipse.gef4.layout.algorithms.BoxLayoutAlgorithm}), or which simply
 * prevent overlapping of nodes ({@link org.eclipse.gef4.layout.algorithms.HorizontalShiftAlgorithm}).
